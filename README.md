# T20 Cricket Team Selection

## Problem Statement

In the context of the 2022 Men's T20 World Cup, the goal is to build an undefeatable cricket team that can achieve a dual target: scoring a minimum of 180 runs in a T20 match and defending at least 150 runs on average. The team selection process involves analyzing player performance data from the 2022 Men's T20 World Cup dataset to identify key contributors in batting, bowling, and all-round performances.

## Project Goals

1. **Team Composition:**
   - Assemble a well-balanced team comprising top-performing batsmen, bowlers, and all-rounders.
   - Consider factors such as batting strike rates, bowling economy rates, and all-round contributions.

2. **Run Scoring:**
   - Identify batsmen with a proven track record of scoring high runs in T20 matches.
   - Formulate a strategy to ensure the team consistently achieves a minimum total of 180 runs.

3. **Defensive Capability:**
   - Select bowlers with a history of effective wicket-taking and economy rates.
   - Develop a robust bowling lineup capable of defending a minimum of 150 runs on average.

4. **All-Round Performance:**
   - Recognize all-rounders who can make significant contributions with both bat and ball.
   - Balance the team with players who can impact the game in multiple dimensions.

5. **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
   - Utilize Python for data analysis, exploring key statistics and metrics.
   - Create visualizations to showcase the performance metrics of selected players.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Maintain clear documentation outlining the rationale behind player selection.
   - Provide insights into the chosen strategies and the expected impact on achieving the team goals.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the 2022 Men's T20 World Cup. It includes comprehensive statistics on player performances, team records, and match outcomes. The dataset will be analyzed to identify standout players meeting the criteria for batting, bowling, and all-round excellence.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather and preprocess the 2022 Men's T20 World Cup dataset.
   - Extract relevant features such as runs scored, batting strike rates, wickets taken, bowling economy rates, etc.

## Implementation

The entire analysis and player selection process will be implemented using Python and popular data analysis libraries. The code and results will be documented in Jupyter Notebooks, ensuring transparency and reproducibility of the entire analysis.

## Conclusion

The goal is to build not just a cricket team but a winning combination that aligns with the specific targets set for run scoring and defending. The project will culminate in the selection of the "Undefeatable XI" for the 2022 Men's T20 World Cup, backed by data-driven insights and a strategic approach.
